## Note
Due to this project being part of the HyperionDev bootcamp, the source code is available in a private repository.
Please contact me if you would like an invitation to the private repository.

# An overview

## A description of how it works
This program is related to architectural projects, and keeps track of the relevant parties involved, which is the customer, contractor, and architect. Other information is also kept, such as the invoice and information about the project itself.

The primary information about the project itself includes:
1. Project name
2. The building type
3. The physical address
4. ERF number
5. Deadline and completion dates
6. The relevant parties (architect, customer, contractor)

## The purpose
This program was created as part of the HyperionDev course, and thus its purpose is purely for practicing/demonstrating existing programming skills. I do not see any practical uses of this program in its current state.

## Who will benefit?
Anybody that is fairly new to Java and interested in the basics of the MVC design pattern.

# Improvements
Aspects of the program that can be improved upon:
1. While this program adds a GUI, making it much more user-friendly, it can still be improved upon, such as in terms of its colors and fonts.
2. A loyal customer base can be implemented, where customers get discounts for future projects.
3. The Swing library can be changed to use the newer JavaFX library for its GUI components.

# Licensing
There is no formal licensing for this program, however any distribution, modification and it being packaged to be sold is NOT permissible. Permission will be given by myself for you to download and use the program on your computer, however please remove it once you are done with it.
